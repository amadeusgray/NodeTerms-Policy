"Do Not Track" requests
Our systems do not respond to Do Not Track requests, and will operate in accordance with this Privacy Policy regardless.

Users under the age of 13
NodeBot is users age 13 and over and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. In countries where the age of consent is older than 13 years, you must be of the required age to use NodeBot.

Data retention and processing
NodeBot is based in the United States, and data is collected and processed on our servers in Germany.

Personal information is only retained as long as necessary. To get rid of data, we may delete or anonymize it, however it may persist in electronic backups.

Rights to your data
Individuals in California, the European Economic Area, Canada, Costa Rica and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. They also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways.

In addition, you can email privacy@streamcord.io with an explanation of what data you would like to have updated or deleted.

How do I object or restrict the manner in which NodeBot processes my personal data?
You have a right to ask us to stop using or limit our use of your personal data in certain circumstancesâ€”for example, if we have no lawful basis to keep using your data, or if you think your personal data is inaccurate.
